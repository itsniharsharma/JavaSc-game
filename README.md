# javaSc-game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissor Game build by using JavaScript <br>
 Was skilling the concepts of language, and this project helped alot! <br>
 enriched my skillset with some other new concepts and ofcource gained experience! <br>
 kept the styling colourful to showcase the type of project-Game:)
