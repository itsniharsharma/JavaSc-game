# javaSc-game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissor Game build by using JavaScript <br>
- Was skilling the concepts of language, and this project helped alot!
-I enriched my skillset with some other new concepts and ofcource gained experience!

I kept the styling colourful to showcase the type of project-Game:)

-Planning to add a new feature of dark-mode in my game! this weakend.
